        <h2>This air fryer salmon is full of flavor of spiciness coming from the cajun seasoning with a hint of sweetness leaving it moist and delicious.</h2>
    
        <p> With a simple and easy recipe only containing 4 ingredients, leaving it ready in under 10-12 minutes.</p>
    
        <p>If using <b>unsalted Cajun seasoning</b>, you may want to season the fillets with salt before serving. I like to use a Misto sprayer with oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray. For <em>best</em> results, use 1-inch-thick, center-cut fillets.</p>
